Search

Search is important. A website should have a simple search box with the avaliability to of advanced search. 

Make search avaliable from every page as this is a users "lifeline" if they get stuck they can use this and we just don't know where they would get stuck.

Users a) do not have good search understanding b) Will likely not try to search twice and finally c) will probably not look past the first page. If you search engine cannot find what people are looking for at this point, it is useless.

PDF

Pretty simply a big no no. Only use for distrutible data.

Changing colours of links

This helps with navigation and means that users know where they have been and can re-visit or avoid.

Non-scannable text

If users don't find the text easy to read, it doesnt matter how good the content is. The key features of an easy to read site are:
- Subheading
- Bullet points
- highlighted keywords
- Short paragraphs
- Simple writing style
- The inverted pyramid
- de-fluffed language

Key word for more info "write for online"

Font size

Respect user preferences and allow them to change the font size. Don't block this in CSS.

Page Titles

They are cloody important - Don't start them with all the same thing. Make them unique to the pages and something that a) you want to show when bookmarked b) you want to show as a tab title and c) you want to show in search engines. 

If you were to have "Welcome" as the first word this doesnt help someone identify the website at all and is a waste of your title realestate and search functionality.

Avoid ad like elements

After years of using the net we have learnt to ignore ads, so if a website has an element that looks like an ad we instantly ignore it. The key elements to avoid are:
- Anything that looks like a banner ad
- Anything that flashes or animates 
- Pop-ups

Keep it consistant

People get lost when things don't react the way they expected and it makes them feel "insecure". 
Secondly, people spend most of their time on other sites so you can't break the norm too much or people will get confused.

Opening links in new windows

Big nonono - It's is acting definsively to stop you going back. Also relates to above = not reacting in an expected way.

Answer the questions

Make the answers obvious to the user. If they are hidden, hard to find or require an email a lot of users will just not bother. This is very common in B2B businesses where they are pushing for you to email them, however it is often not realistic.
